  <h1>How to keep hard-boiled eggs from getting rubbery</h1>
  <p><em>Short, practical answer.</em></p>

  <h2>Short answer</h2>
  <p>
    Eggs turn rubbery when they’re overheated (or reheated too hot/too long). Cool them fast after boiling,
    store them sealed in the fridge, and reheat gently—prefer hot water, not high heat.
  </p>

  <h2>What causes rubbery eggs</h2>
  <p>
    Overheating tightens egg proteins and squeezes out moisture, especially in the whites. Reheating is usually
    the biggest culprit.
  </p>

  <h2>Do this instead</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cool immediately:</strong> move cooked eggs to cold water/ice bath for 5–10 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Store sealed:</strong> keep in a covered container (peeled eggs benefit most).</li>
    <li><strong>Eat cold if possible:</strong> avoids reheating texture issues.</li>
    <li><strong>Reheat gently:</strong> warm in hot water (not boiling) for a few minutes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Should you freeze hard-boiled eggs?</h2>
  <p>
    Whole hard-boiled eggs don’t freeze well—whites usually get tough and watery after thawing.
    If you need freezer storage, freeze <strong>yolks only</strong>, or freeze chopped eggs mixed into egg salad.
